# IT-Support-Automation-Monitoring-System
This project automates common technical support tasks, such as log monitoring, system health checks, and ticket creation. The system integrates with a ticketing tool (like Jira, Zendesk, or ServiceNow) through their APIs and automatically creates or updates tickets when an issue is detected.
